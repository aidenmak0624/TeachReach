### Branching

We are adopting the Git-flow branching strategy.

There are 2 main branches in out project, main and dev. All development of tasks
should be done in their own feature branches that are branched from dev.

Feature branch should be named in the following format:
iteration#/feature name/task

Make a merge request for merging into dev from your branch
if you think your feature is completed.

A merge to main should only be done for an iteration release.
