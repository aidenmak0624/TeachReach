# Retrospective: Iteration 1

Group 2 - Git Gud

## Discussion

Our project had a slow start due to initial unfamiliarity with Android Studio, Android libraries, and git collaboration. However, as iteration 1 progressed, we found our rhythm, divided tasks, and improved collaboration over git. Reflecting on our progress, we've identified both what went well and areas for improvement:


### What went well:

#### Work Distribution:

- Roles and responsibilities were clearly defined

#### Group Communication:

- Responses within the group were prompt

### Areas for Improvement:

#### Work-flow:

- Late start due to lack of understanding of tools and language
- Lack of defined timeline
- Tasks were delayed

#### Group Communication:

- Need for more proactive communication to inform each other of code expectations (e.g. need to discuss what data and its format a team member needs to work on their task with team member working on associated class)

#### Commit/Branching Strategy:

- branch naming is inconsistent and lacks proper format
- Confusion in branch/merge process, lack of familiarity with git controls
- Overlapping work causing merge conflicts
- Commits perform multiple unrelated tasks, touching multiple files

#### User Story Planning:

- Some user stories were too general and need to be broken down

### Next Steps:

#### Work-flow Management:

- Establish clear timelines, objectives, expectations

#### Communication Improvement:

- Discuss needs of each team member to complete their tasks
- Provide detailed task planning

#### Branching Strategy Enhancement:

- Designate one person to control main/dev branches by using merge requests
- Implement a protocol for branch naming

#### User Story Refinement:

- Break down complex user stories into more refined and clearer tasks.
