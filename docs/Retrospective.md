### **Retrospective**

Group Git Gud
In iteration One:

Base on the expectation, the work distribution, work-flow, group communication, branching strategy, user story planning, code quality, and performace, we sums up few points on objective reflection.


**For Expectation**
<br>Bad:
 - We focus on individual expectation

**For Work distribution:**
<br>Good:
 - We have a clear work distribution.
 - We know which people are responsible for whch part of the project.

**For Work-flow:**
<br>Bad:
 - We started late 
 - should set up time line
 - some works delated

**For Group communication:**
<br>Good:
 - group could response
<br>Bad:
 - Need more communication

**For Branching strategy:**
<br>Bad:
 - The branch/merge is messy and confused
 - Not familiar with git control (when to commit, pull, push)

**For User story planning:**
<br>Bad:
 - the user story is too large to complete

**For Code quality:**
<br>Bad:
 - Some program is not applicable to other program due to DSO.

**Overall**
<br>Good:
 - We did our best and contributed:D
<br>Bad
 - We need better work planning, communiation.


Here is what we could do on next iteration to make group functions in a more effective way.

1. Set up time line for work-flow, eg: make schedule, objective, expectation, reasons for dealine.
2. more initiative communication on your work, eg: make dev task eariler on and make detailed planning
3. Better branching strategy, eg: one man control git main/dev and others end request for merge, another one would be making protocol to name the branch
4. break up the user story expectation, eg: modify the user story from (make a whole program/system) to (view/ edit small stuff)

[create data stub(Accountstub, CourseStub, SessionStub(not released)) and add a server](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2024/git-gud-a02-2/-/commit/8f2dd5646f7682c042ef3b4f945363a68bcfd0cf)
<br>

[server code](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2024/git-gud-a02-2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/comp3350/teachreach/logic/Server.java?ref_type=heads)
combining each could make the program more coherient and reduce coupling as it there are a server to create stub and all logic layers could work on the database.
